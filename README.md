# bootstrap4-5projects
This is a repository from my code from Bootstrap 4 from scratch with 5 projects course on Udemy. Source: https://www.udemy.com/course/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/


* First project is Looplab, a responsive webpage for a traditional social network. 
* Second project is Mizuxe, a responsive webpage for a book. It also was built using SASS for creating custom CSS.
* Third project is Glozzom, a responsive website (multiple pages) for a company who sell "services". It uses bootstrap lightbox https://github.com/ashleydw/lightbox
* Fourth project is Bloggen, a theme for a 'wordpress' inspired CMS.
* Fifth and final project is portfoliogrid, a theme for a responsive portfolio webpage.

> All projects were built using bootstrap 4, fontawesome for icons, some custom CSS and a bit of jquery.
